Let’s pretend that we are designing a veterinary trial for a vaccine against Hepatitis E for pigs. The probability to become infected following an exposure is pc = 0.5 for untreated pigs. The developer of the vaccine believes that this probability is reduced to pv = 0.1 following vaccination. The control and treatment arms have the same number of pigs, N, and the statistical significance is evaluated via a permutation test. How should we choose N to ensure that we have approximately 90% chance of seeing a difference between the control and treatment arms that is significant at α = 0.05 level?
This problem can be solved by a large number of methods. I suggest that you pursue a computational approach. That is implement classes or functions that simulate the outcomes in control and treatment arms; implement a class or function that performs a permutation test; and determine the probability of a statistically significant difference at α = 0.05 level for a few values of N. Based on that plot, determine a suitable value of N that the problem asks for. Then perform simulations at this N and confirm that there is indeed about 90% chance that the trial passes the statistical test.
