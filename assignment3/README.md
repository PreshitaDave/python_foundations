Consider a one-dimensional random walker that can move every second. With probability pl = 1/3 it moves to the left, with probability pr = 1/3 it moves to right, and with probability ps = 1/3 it rests/stays and does not move. Assuming at time t = 0, the random walker is at x = 0, plot the probability density function and the cumulative probability function for t = 10, t = 100, and t = 1000 seconds. Make just two plots; each showing all three time points. Remember that you need to simulate random walks many times to get good statistics. Make the same two plots for pl = 0, pr = 1/2, and ps = 1/2. Do you understand why these plots look different? The plots that you make should be designed well. For example, they should label curves, axes, etc.
